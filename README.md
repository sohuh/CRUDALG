This code is a basic algorithim that can sort out files based off three indicators, a 1 in the batchfile means you want to add a record, a 2 means you want to search for a record, a 3 means you want to edit a record, a 4 means you want to delete a record 
and, a 5 means you want to sort the records by one of two criterias A-Z or by the plays count.
